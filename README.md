# Washers
Creating a scoring system/app for 3 hole washers to eventually track stats and make into a phone app

## Plan:
- Create multiple classes to aid in code reusability: (Team ✅, Board ✅, Player ✅, Throw)
- Allow for rules enforcement and auto calculation of score
- Features to add
  - Covers ✅
  - Busts
  - Washers back

## Future:
- Ideally this allows logs of every throw into a database so stats can be run against it
- Long term: create an actual physical device with 3 buttons per team to auto calculate score on the beach and after each game provide feedback and data uplink
